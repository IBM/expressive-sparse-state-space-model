## Environment

The base environment only consists of a few packages.

```
conda create -n pdssm_pytorch python=3.10
conda activate pdssm_pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments

### Reproduce Experiments

The PD-SSM experiment configurations are saved in JSON format in ```./experiment_configs```. 
Each JSON config file corresponds to a task-seed combination.
For example, to train PD-SSM on parity with the seed 2, execute the following command:

```
python run_experiment.py -c parity_2
```

The checkpoints are stored in ```./checkpoints``` and the results are stored in ```./results```.

To analyse the results, execute the following command which prints the best validation accuracy for each task/seed combination in ```./results```:

```
python analyse_results.py
```

### Implementation details

This submodule is implemented in PyTorch, with the PD-SSM model implemented in a fully recurrent way, treating the column-sparse matrices as if they were unstructured and utilizing the standard operation

```
toch.matmul(A_t, x_t_minus_1)
```

The second submodule (time_series_JAX) provides a JAX implementation which utilizes an efficient parallel associative scan function.
